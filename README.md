Here you can see all my homeworks that were done during the courses of Vadim Ksendzov "Software testing course" and Artsiom Rusau - "Functional testing of Software"

**Software testing course by Vadim Ksendzov**
In the absence of formal documentation for testing, the testing of API were based on the guidance and instructions provided by the owner of the course.


**Functional testing of Software course by Artsiom Rusau**

The documentation utilized for the functional testing of software was sourced from the official documentation provided by the Swagger Petstore API, available at _https://petstore.swagger.io/._
